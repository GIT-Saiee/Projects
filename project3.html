Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #1:</span> My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #2:</span> I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #3:</span> Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #4:</span> I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #5:</span> When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #6:</span> I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".</h3>

 <h3><span id="story-color">User Story #7:</span> My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #8:</span> Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #9:</span> The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #10:</span> The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #11:</span> Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #12:</span> When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #13:</span>  The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.</h3>

<h3><span id="story-color">User Story #14:</span> My product landing page should have at least one media query.</h3>
