    By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my

    calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus.”

    Small of stature, rock like in faith, Mother Teresa of Calcutta was entrusted with the mission of

    proclaiming God’s thirsting love for humanity, especially for the poorest of the poor. “God

    still loves the world and He sends you and me to be His love and His compassion to the

    poor.” She was a soul filled with the light of Christ, on fire with love for Him and burning with

    one desire: “to quench His thirst for love and for souls.”
